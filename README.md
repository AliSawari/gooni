Gooni is a CLI-based library that allows you to add pre-built components directly to your project without any extra installation or dependencies. Similar to ShadCN UI, Gooni makes it easy to integrate high-quality components by simply copying the code into your project.

</div>

## Features

- **Direct Integration**: Add components with a single command.
- **No Installation Needed**: Copy components directly to your project without additional dependencies.
- **Flexible Usage**: Customize as needed with no constraints.

## Installation and Usage

To add a component using Gooni, use the following command:

```bash
npx gooni@latest add <component-name>
```

Replace `<component-name>` with the name of the component you'd like to add.

### Example

To add a filterable-option-list component, you can use:

```bash
npx gooni@latest add filterable-option-list
```

This will copy the code for the button component directly into your project for immediate use.
